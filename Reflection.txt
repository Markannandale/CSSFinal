1) I chose to go for a simple design for this site page, so that greater attention can be placed on the more important elements, like the carousel. I also used Bootstrap for this site, as it's easily scalable with mobile and desktop sites.
2) I did struggle a bit with creating a logo using SVG, but I did eventually find a design that worked.
3) I'm very pleased with how I was able to get the layout to work on both desktop and mobile screens.
4) I've learned how to leverage several of the topics we've covered in class (including Bootstrap, SVG, and animations) to create a well-structured, functional site.
